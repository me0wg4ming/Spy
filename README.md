## üîç Detection Features

### 1. Proactive Scanning (SuperWoW)

- Scans for nearby enemy players every 0.5 seconds (this is only for already detected players - new detected players will be scanned instantly)
- Works WITHOUT combat - finds idle/stealthed players
- GUID-based tracking for accuracy

### 2. Stealth Detection (Multiple Methods)

Spy uses three complementary methods to detect stealthed enemies:

#### Method A: Buff Scanning (Tooltip Scanner)
- **How it works:** Scans target's buffs using tooltip analysis
- **Detects:** Stealth, Prowl, Shadowmeld, Vanish
- **Languages:** English and German patterns supported
- **Interval:** Every 0.5 seconds for detected players
- **Advantage:** Works on any targeted enemy

#### Method B: UNIT_CASTEVENT (Instant Detection)
- **How it works:** Listens for stealth spell casts in real-time
- **Detects:** Instant notification when stealth is activated
- **Spell IDs tracked:**
  - Stealth (Rogue): 1784, 1785, 1786, 1787
  - Prowl (Druid): 5215, 6783, 9913
  - Shadowmeld (Night Elf): 20580
  - Vanish (Rogue): 1856, 1857
- **Advantage:** Zero delay, immediate alert

#### Method C: Stealth-Only Mode
- **How it works:** Detects stealthed players even when Spy is disabled
- **Enable:** Set `WarnOnStealthEvenIfDisabled = true` in config
- **Classes filtered:** Only processes Rogues, Druids, and Night Elves
- **Use case:** Perfect for battlegrounds/instances where you want main Spy off but still need stealth alerts
- **Advantage:** Minimal resource usage while maintaining stealth awareness

### 3. Smart Filtering

- ‚úÖ Only tracks: Players + Hostile + PvP Flagged + Alive
- ‚úÖ Ignores: Friendlies, Pets, NPCs, Same-Faction (even in duels)
- ‚úÖ Separate caches for enemies/friendlies
- ‚úÖ Automatic pet detection via class check + UnitPlayerControlled

### 4. Zone-Based Control

---

## üîß Technical Details

### How SuperWoW Integration Works

#### 1. GUID Collection
- Events: UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT, PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED, UNIT_COMBAT, etc.
- Stores GUIDs of all players encountered
- Name-to-GUID mapping for targeting

#### 2. Scanning System
- Interval: 0.5 seconds (configurable)
- Filter: IsPlayer + IsHostile + IsPvPFlagged + IsAlive
- Cleanup: Every 5 seconds (removes non-existent GUIDs)

#### 3. Data Extraction
- Level (exact, no guessing!)
- Class & Race
- Guild
- Stealth status (via buff scanning)
- Faction (for duel detection)

#### 4. Stealth Detection
- Buff scanning with Tooltip Scanner (works with GUIDs!)
- UNIT_CASTEVENT for instant detection
- Multi-language support (EN/DE patterns)
- Same-faction filtering (no duel alerts)

### Performance

- **Scan Interval:** 0.5s (500ms)
- **CPU Load:** ~0.5% with 50 tracked GUIDs
- **Memory:** Minimal, automatic cleanup
- **Pet Filtering:** Intelligent class + UnitPlayerControlled check

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: Spy doesn't load

**Check:**
1. Folder structure: `Interface/AddOns/Spy/Spy.lua` must exist
2. Only ONE Spy version installed
3. Delete `Spy_OLD` copies

**Fix:**
```
Delete Interface/AddOns/Spy*
Extract fresh Spy-SuperWoW.zip
```

### Problem: SuperWoW not detected

**Symptoms:**
- Error message on login
- `/spystatus` shows "NOT AVAILABLE"

**Fix:**
1. Verify SuperWoW installation: https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW
2. Check for SuperWoW DLL in WoW folder
3. Test with other SuperWoW addons (ShaguQuest, pfUI)
4. Reinstall SuperWoW

### Problem: Too many detections / Spam

**Causes:**
- Debug mode active
- Low scan interval

**Fix:**
1. `/spydebug` - Disable debug mode
2. Edit `SpySuperWoW.lua` line ~85: `SpySW.SCAN_INTERVAL = 1.0` (default: 0.5)

### Problem: Stealth not detected

**Check:**
1. Target enemy player
2. `/spybuff` - Test buff detection
3. Check which methods work
4. Enable debug: `/spydebug`

**Note:** Tooltip Scanner (Method 8) should work best with SuperWoW

### Problem: Error on profile switch

**Symptoms:**
- Lua error when changing profiles
- "attempt to index nil value"

**Fix:**
- Fixed in 3.9.3! Profile system now works correctly
- If still happening, `/reload` after profile change

### Problem: Players not targetable

**Symptoms:**
- Click doesn't target
- "Cannot target" in debug

**Check:**
1. SuperWoW installed? (GUID targeting requires it)
2. Player out of range? (SuperWoW can target further than normal)
3. Enable debug: `/spydebug` and check GUID tracking

### Problem: Pets showing as players

**Symptoms:**
- Hunter/Warlock pets in list
- "Wolf" or "Voidwalker" detected

**Status:** Fixed in 3.9.3!
- Dual-check: NOT IsPlayer AND IsPlayerControlled = Pet
- Class verification (pets have no class)
- See debug: "SKIPPED PET: <name>"

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Optimal Settings

- **Scan Interval:** 0.5s for fast detection, 1.0s for low-end PCs
- **Debug Mode:** OFF except for testing
- **Auto-Resize:** ON for dynamic window size
- **Stealth-Only Mode:** Great for instances/BGs where you want Spy off

### Performance Optimization

- **High player density (>100):** Increase scan interval to 1.0s
- **During raids:** Turn off debug mode
- **Low FPS:** Increase scan interval + disable auto-resize

### Stealth Detection

- **Best Method:** UNIT_CASTEVENT (instant, no delay)
- **Backup:** Buff scanning (0.5s delay)
- **Most Reliable:** Both enabled (default)

### Targeting Out-of-Range Players

- SuperWoW allows targeting beyond normal range
- Click player in list, even if they're far away
- GUID-based targeting works as long as they were detected once
