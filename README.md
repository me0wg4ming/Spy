## üîß Technical Details

### How SuperWoW Integration Works:

**1. GUID Collection:**
- Events: UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT, PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED, UNIT_COMBAT, etc.
- Stores GUIDs of all players encountered
- Name-to-GUID mapping for targeting

**2. Scanning System:**
- Interval: 0.5 seconds (configurable)
- Filter: IsPlayer + IsHostile + IsPvPFlagged + IsAlive
- Cleanup: Every 5 seconds (removes non-existent GUIDs)

**3. Data Extraction:**
- Level (exact, no guessing!)
- Class & Race
- Guild
- Stealth status (via buff scanning)
- Faction (for duel detection)

**4. Stealth Detection:**
- Buff scanning with Tooltip Scanner (works with GUIDs!)
- UNIT_CASTEVENT for instant detection
- Multi-language support (EN/DE patterns)
- Same-faction filtering (no duel alerts)

### Performance:
- **Scan Interval:** 0.5s (500ms)
- **CPU Load:** ~0.5% with 50 tracked GUIDs
- **Memory:** Minimal, automatic cleanup
- **Pet Filtering:** Intelligent class + UnitPlayerControlled check

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: Spy doesn't load

**Check:**
1. Folder structure: `Interface/AddOns/Spy/Spy.lua` must exist
2. Only ONE Spy version installed
3. Delete `Spy_OLD` copies

**Fix:**
```
Delete Interface/AddOns/Spy*
Extract fresh Spy-SuperWoW.zip
```

---

### Problem: SuperWoW not detected

**Symptoms:**
- Error message on login
- `/spystatus` shows "NOT AVAILABLE"

**Fix:**
1. Verify SuperWoW installation: https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW
2. Check for SuperWoW DLL in WoW folder
3. Test with other SuperWoW addons (ShaguQuest, pfUI)
4. Reinstall SuperWoW

---

### Problem: Too many detections / Spam

**Causes:**
- Debug mode active
- Low scan interval

**Fix:**
1. `/spydebug` - Disable debug mode
2. Edit `SpySuperWoW.lua` line ~85: `SpySW.SCAN_INTERVAL = 1.0` (default: 0.5)

---

### Problem: Stealth not detected

**Check:**
1. Target enemy player
2. `/spybuff` - Test buff detection
3. Check which methods work
4. Enable debug: `/spydebug`

**Note:** Tooltip Scanner (Method 8) should work best with SuperWoW

---

### Problem: Error on profile switch

**Symptoms:**
- Lua error when changing profiles
- "attempt to index nil value"

**Fix:**
- Fixed in 3.9.3! Profile system now works correctly
- If still happening, `/reload` after profile change

---

### Problem: Players not targetable

**Symptoms:**
- Click doesn't target
- "Cannot target" in debug

**Check:**
1. SuperWoW installed? (GUID targeting requires it)
2. Player out of range? (SuperWoW can target further than normal)
3. Enable debug: `/spydebug` and check GUID tracking

---

### Problem: Pets showing as players

**Symptoms:**
- Hunter/Warlock pets in list
- "Wolf" or "Voidwalker" detected

**Status:** Fixed in 3.9.3!
- Dual-check: NOT IsPlayer AND IsPlayerControlled = Pet
- Class verification (pets have no class)
- See debug: "SKIPPED PET: <name>"

Debug Mode: OFF except for testing
Auto-Resize: ON for dynamic window size
Stealth-Only Mode: Great for instances/BGs where you want Spy off

Performance Optimization:

High player density (>100): Increase scan interval to 1.0s
During raids: Turn off debug mode
Low FPS: Increase scan interval + disable auto-resize

Stealth Detection:

Best Method: UNIT_CASTEVENT (instant, no delay)
Backup: Buff scanning (0.5s delay)
Most Reliable: Both enabled (default)

Targeting Out-of-Range Players:

SuperWoW allows targeting beyond normal range
Click player in list, even if they're far away
GUID-based targeting works as long as they were detected once
